All users of the BLACS should read "A User's Guide to the BLACS v1.1".
Users may also be interested in the quick reference guides for the C and
Fortran77 interfaces to the BLACS.

Before you can compile anything, you must first edit and correct the file
BLACS/Bmake.inc.  Sample Bmake.inc's can be found in the BLACS/BMAKES
directories.  See the paper "Installing and Testing the BLACS" for details.

Users of the MPIBLACS should also read the two small notes on the BLACS
and their interaction with MPI:  "Outstanding Issues in the MPIBLACS",
and "Some Plebian Extensions to MPI".

All of these papers are available in the blacs/ directory on netlib.
