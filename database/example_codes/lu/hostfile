# This is the default hostfile for Open MPI.  Notice that it does not
# contain any hosts (not even localhost).  This file should only
# contain hosts if a system administrator wants users to always have
# the same set of default hosts, and is not using a batch scheduler
# (such as SLURM, PBS, etc.).  
#
# If you are primarily interested in running Open MPI on one node, you
# should *not* simply list "localhost" in here (contrary to prior MPI
# implementations, such as LAM/MPI).  A localhost-only node list is
# created by the RAS component named "localhost" if no other RAS
# components were able to find any hosts to run on (this behavior can
# be disabled by excluding the localhost RAS component by specifying
# the value "^localhost" [without the quotes] to the "ras" MCA
# parameter).
